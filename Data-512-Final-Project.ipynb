    "# Recommender Systems\n",

    "10th December, 2017  \n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommender system is a software that analyzes large amounts of data and extracts personal characteristics and features to present users with relevant content.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we go to Amazon today and look for \"Machine learning with the Tensor flow\" book, I would get recommendations like \"Customer who bought this item also bought this item\"; \"Items Frequently brought together\"; \"More items to consider\"; \"Recommendation for you in books\" and many more variations of recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of recommender systems is interesting and important as it involves business-centric, engineering-centric and human-centric approaches to design RS. It solves a real-world problem and tackles unresolved research questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Business-centric - \n",
    "The fundamental reason why many companies seem to care about recommender systems is for money and business as they generate significant user engagement and revenue. But, Advertisements biases the recommendation on platforms like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, IMDB, TMDB, Spotify etc. Hence, using the traditional approaches, we built an unbiased recommender system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering-centric - \n",
    "Also, building a recommender system is a true data science problem. It is a true representation and intersection between Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Statistics and Human-Centered Interaction as building it requires all these skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human-centric - \n",
    "But most importantly Recommender System is a human-centric problem statement as the system is for the humans and the results and performance complete depends on Human Recommender interaction. We built models whose end product or outcome can be easily interpreted. Further, these models are build taking into account the audience, purpose, and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every company is working and using recommender systems in today's era. It is not at all surprising to us if we sign-in to some application and get recommendations the very next minute in our inbox. Since the work in this field is rapidly growing and the techniques are improving tremendously, there comes a big question regarding the human recommender interaction and how these algorithms are positively affecting the user's choices. Michael D. Ekstrand, F. Maxwell Harper, Martijn C. Willemsen, and Joseph A. Konstan conducted a research in 2014 on User perception of differences in recommender algorithms [10]. Further studies have been conducted in understanding the human-centered aspect for such sophisticated algorithms. Sean M. McNee, Nishikant Kapoor, and Joseph A. Konstan published in 2006 a research on \"Don't look stupid: avoiding pitfalls when recommending research papers\" [16]. The research that closely relates or connects to what we are doing in this project is by Sean M. McNee, John Riedl, and Joseph A. Konstan. 2006. Making recommendations better: an analytic model for human-recommender interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses/ research questions\n",
    "For our research project, we deliver two recommendation algorithms from scratch without using the already built libraries for such algorithms like MLlib.\n",
    "Further, we tried to answer two hypotheses -\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses 1 - Compare the recommender personality of content-based and collaborative filtering RS\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses 2 - Why should a user trust that the algorithm understands who they are, what they like and what they are doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this research inform your hypotheses, your analysis, or your system design? \n",
    "Human-centered data science fills the gap between or it is the bridge between quantitative and qualitative research. This bridge opens new opportunities, for instance, Data Scientist role is also one of the many outcomes from the amalgamation of a deep connection between qualitative methods and formally defined data-driven research technique.\n",
    "The project is a true representation of what we studied during the lectures and the take-home readings. From this project, we cover important aspects using the hypothesis like the interpretability, data privacy, data ethics and understand the bridge of HCDS between qualitative and quantitative methods.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analytical methods\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "Content-based recommender systems concentrate on the characteristics of the items and give recommendations based on the similarity between them, that is if you like an item then you will also like a “similar” item. For calculating the similarity between movies, we are using two features - overview and taglines. We are calculating the cosine similarity between movies by converting the textual features into numerical feature vectors using tf-idf vectorizer from sci-kit learn package.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Content-based Filtering\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is an unsupervised learning algorithm which produces recommendations based on the knowledge of user’ attitude to items, that is it uses the “wisdom of the crowd” and \"past behavior\" to recommend items. For calculating the similarity between movies, we are Pearson correlation coefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Hybrid Approach\n",
    "The amalgamation of Collaborative filtering and content-based approach is called a hybrid approach. It is very powerful technique as it takes advantages of both the approaches and eliminates the disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What methods are we using and why these methods?\n",
    "We are concentrating on Content-based and Collaborative Filtering algorithm as these are traditional approaches to build a recommendation engine. Both the approaches are mutually exclusive and the results depend on what we want to achieve. In Collaborative filtering, recommender system tries to consider the similarities between users on the platform and based on these similarities, movies that similar neighbors of the target user showed interest in are equally recommended to him, her or them. This approach gives room for more diverse or serendipitous recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in Content-based approach, recommendations are made to the user based on their movie interests. Movies are only recommended to the user if he had shown interest in that genre, tags or related attribute previously. This approach lacks some diversity and serendipity but may useful recommend movies that the user may like now just because he had liked movies with similar attributes before. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis includes the involvement of human aspect. Fortunately, research in the field of recommender systems still remains powerful and alive. There have been great advancements and development in these approaches. Moreover, Information filtering can be more effective when users are involved in the algorithmic process genuinely. We believe that to be true now more than ever because working on transparency of the recommender systems, and enabling ever-improving suggestions from users is both meaningful and challenging.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations or risk of your study \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.Lack/ Change of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is a very a small snapshot of the real world population. This makes the whole research questionable as the findings we got can be changed if the dataset changes or the size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2.Change in the attributes for content-based approach \n",
    "\n",
    "We considered taglines and overview feature of the movie to create content based recommender algorithm, but if we change the attributes/features then the recommendations are at greater risk of being changed/modified. Hence, this further bolsters our second research question that why should the user trust that the algorithm understand user's liking and dislikes. Therefore, any change in the algorithm or feature selection can be reflected while showing the recommendation for the use. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.Expected outcome and understanding of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the project concentrates on the Human Recommender Interaction - how the personality of the two approaches differ and how to accurately present the recommendation to users - therefore, the expected outcome and understanding of the results may differ person to person.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.Intuition based study\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the project is more research centric and less data analytics or visualization centric, the outcome of the project can be perceived differently and there could be many discussions and arguments that can arise from this project which is a great opportunity for further study and research work in the field of Human Recommender Interaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion and Future work\n",
    "From our research project, we tried to build to recommendation algorithms from scratch without using the already built libraries for such algorithms like MLlib and tried to answer two hypothesis -\n",
    "1. Compare the recommender personality of content-based and collaborative filtering RS\n",
    "2. Why should a user trust that the algorithm understands who they are, what they like and what they are doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this project we compared and predicted the subjective characteristics of recommendation algorithm. We find that the recommendations from collaborative filtering approach are quite diverse and fresh, whereas the recommendations from content-based approach are quite the opposite. It depends on the requirement of the users and what kind of recommendations they would like. If a user is a binge-watcher then content-based approach sounds apt for the user as we try to binge-watch the series of movies in one go. Hence, the recommendations are situational and the usefulness of the recommendation depends on the mood of the users. Moreover, whatever recommendation we provide to the user, the two key important factors to keep in mind is awareness and explanation of the recommendations. Let the users be aware of how we are adapting to their tastes and make it clear that we are not recommending movies/items because it suits our business needs, but because it matches the information we have from them: their explicit taste preferences and ratings, their viewing history.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, we plan to add user evaluations of recommender systems as well. We want to understand what makes recommendations more effective and useful, hence we can add experiments where users compare the recommendations produced by the two algorithms - content-based and collaborative filtering - based on dimensions like innovation, variety, efficiency, satisfaction, and degree of personalization, and out of the two sets of recommendation select a recommender that they would like to use in the future. We hope to garner data using the modern survey technique which will also be useful for developing, evaluating and refining additional measures of recommender behavior and personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kind of studies are new in the field as it is the combination of both qualitative and quantitative research methodology, which includes modern survey designs, analysis techniques and prediction of subjective characteristics, and direct comparison study of recommender algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, my contribution to this project is an initial building block towards understanding how users comprehend and interact with recommenders systems. Such interactions are critical for building better tools and meeting users' requirements. We look forward the future work, from the whole Data Science community including ourselves, for building a well-organized and systematic understanding of how to produce powerful, beneficial, and engaging recommendations in a broad range of applications.\n",
